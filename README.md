Student Class Lab Project

Welcome to the Student Class Lab Project! This project explores the implementation of an abstract class, an interface, and a concrete class in Java to understand core object-oriented programming concepts. This repository showcases the collaboration and coding skills developed by our team during this lab.


ðŸ“š Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to:
1. Define shared attributes and methods using an abstract class.
2. Enforce specific behaviors through an interface.
3. Combine both the abstract class and interface in a concrete class.

ðŸ›  Project Details

Abstract Class: Person
- Fields: firstName, lastName, and age.
- Methods:
  - getFullName(): Returns the full name of the person (first and last name combined).
  - displayDetails(): Abstract method for displaying the details of the person.

Interface: Studyable
- Method:
  - describeStudy(): Enforces the implementation of a method to describe what a person studies.

Concrete Class: Student
- Extends the Person abstract class and implements the Studyable interface.
- Additional Field: major (the student's field of study).
- Implemented Methods:
  - displayDetails(): Displays the full name, age, and major of the student.
  - describeStudy(): Describes what the student is studying.


ðŸ’» How It Works

1. Create objects of the Student class with details like name, age, and major.
2. Use the methods to:
   - Display the student's full details.
   - Describe what the student is studying.
